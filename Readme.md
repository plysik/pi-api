>App that is visualizing next digits of number Π 

This an atempt of recreating one of Martin Krzywicki's colourful works from 2013. He prepared them to celebrate Π day. Here you can see more versions and more more his works: http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/pi/piday/posters.mhtml

## API

I'm using API hosted on https://helloacm.com/pi to fetch digits of Π.
